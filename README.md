The commmand line prompt is as follows:

npm run start --database='trap_photos_by_mac' --key='001C2C1B26097F0B' --redisbase='latest'


database: Which redis collection you are looking to search through.

key: What the collection is keyed on. Usually a mac address.

redisbase: Either 'latest' or 'general'.

This requires a config file that @stranter can give.
